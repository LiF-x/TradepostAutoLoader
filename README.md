Please note: This mod will remove any current trades you have set up and replace it with trades included in this mod.
 - This will also reset prices at every restart!

 If you wish to allow it to continue to reset prices and trades leave it as "mod.cs"
 - This mod is designed to allow for flash Deals such as reduced prices for items which will reset back after a restart.
